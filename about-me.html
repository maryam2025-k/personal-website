        <!---- 3 model of inspiration-->
        <h3 style="color:white">Here are  my three notable models of inspiration that have been widely recognized for their impact in various fields.</h3>
        <ol style="color:white">
            <li><b>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:</b>
                Developed by Abraham Maslow, this psychological theory suggests that human needs are structured in a hierarchy, ranging from basic physiological needs to self-actualization. When individuals fulfill their basic needs, they become motivated to reach higher levels of aspiration and personal growth, inspiring both personal and organizational development</li>
            <li><b>The HERO's Journey (Monomyth):</b>Coined by Joseph Campbell in his work "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," the Hero's Journey is a narrative framework that illustrates a hero's adventure, challenges, growth, and ultimate transformation. It serves as an inspiration for storytelling across cultures and can motivate individuals to embrace their personal journeys, confront their challenges, and seek growth through adversity.</li>
            <li><b>Growth Mindset:</b>Popularized by psychologist Carol Dweck, the Growth Mindset theory posits that individuals who believe their abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work are more likely to succeed. This mindset encourages resilience, fosters a love for learning, and inspires people to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and ultimately achieve their goals.</li>
